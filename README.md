Install and run project : 


## Backend
1. cd into "Server" folder, containing Server.js
2. In terminal, run "npm install"
3. After dependencies are installed, run "npm start" in terminal to start server.

"npm start" runs a script defined in package.json, starting the server using Nodemon. 
Nodemon is a devtool used when developing node-driven servers, enabling users to not have to restart server once changes are made,
as nodemon restarts server on file saved.

## Android application
As the application is a multiplayer application, two instances of the game must run simultaneously.
To do this, literally clone the project to another folder, and open the project in the same way you open the main project.
Running the game must be done this way, due to Android Studio not allowing running multiple instances of the same project simultaneously(even though it says it's possible).
Run project from both Android Studio instances, and you're gtg.
